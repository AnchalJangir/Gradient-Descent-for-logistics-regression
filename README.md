# Gradient-Descent-for-logistics-regression
I developed python code using gradient descent for logistic regression for SVM light data set ( data set having classes 1 and -1) 
Please find the attached file for a better understading for the problem.
I used a9a data set, general code can be use for the any other SVM light data set. here, I am attching a link for the data sets- " https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html "
